# UI for Kulttuurin kummilapset / Culture Kids

## About

### What?

In the Culture Kids project the City promises that every child born in Helsinki from 2020 on will have an artistic or cultural institution as a “culture guardian”, through which the child and his family will get a personal connection to art. This collaboration is to be continued until the child goes to school.

Participation in the cultural activities planned for the child's age contributes to the artistic development of the child and the well-being of the family, while providing the family with a connection to the society. This action implements the right of the child to art and culture (UNESCO).

### How?

The parents of the child will receive the invitation letter sent by the children´s counselor (Lasten neuvola). Those wishing to participate sign up for the project through this service. The art & culture institute will then send those families information about the events via e-mail. Families will book events suitable for them using this project. Events are free to attend for the families.

### When?

Children born in 2020 will become the children of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. From 2021 onwards, every year a new form of art will be added to the project.

The cities´ Children´s Councilors (lasten neuvolat) and Early Childhood Education are involved in this project and will communicate as experts.

## Development

### Getting started

- Clone the repo.
- Create `.env.development.local` from `.env.development` if you need to modify some environment variable. For more, check [this](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables#docsNav)
- Run `yarn start`.

For isolated developing environment, you can use our Docker instructions.

### .env variables

Change REACT_APP_ELIGIBLE_CITIES if you wish to use the project in another city or municipality.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn update-translations`

Fetches translation data from our Google Spreadsheet and updates translation files. See `.env` for configuration.

You still need to update jest snapshots and add the translation files to the git repository manually.

### `yarn graphql-types`

Generate static types for GraphQL queries by using the schema from the backend server.

## Docker

`docker-compose up` to start the dockerized dev-environment. Not for production!!!  
`docker-compose down` stops the container.

## Setting up development environment locally with docker

### Set tunnistamo hostname

Add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on mac and linux):

    127.0.0.1 tunnistamo-backend

### Create a new OAuth app on GitHub

Go to https://github.com/settings/developers/ and add a new app with the following settings:

- Application name: can be anything, e.g. local tunnistamo
- Homepage URL: http://tunnistamo-backend:8000
- Authorization callback URL: http://tunnistamo-backend:8000/accounts/github/login/callback/

Save. You'll need the created **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for configuring tunnistamo in the next step.

### Install local tunnistamo

Clone https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/tunnistamo/.

Follow the instructions for setting up tunnistamo locally. Before running `docker-compose up` set the following settings in tunnistamo roots `docker-compose.env.yaml`:

- SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY: **Client ID** from the GitHub OAuth app
- SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET: **Client Secret** from the GitHub OAuth app

After you've got tunnistamo running locally, ssh to the tunnistamo docker container:

`docker-compose exec django bash`

and execute the following four commands inside your docker container:

```bash
./manage.py add_oidc_client -n kukkuu-ui -t "id_token token" -u "http://localhost:3000/callback" "http://localhost:3000/silent_renew" -i https://api.hel.fi/auth/kukkuu-ui -m github -s dev
./manage.py add_oidc_client -n kukkuu-api -t "code" -u http://localhost:8081/return -i https://api.hel.fi/auth/kukkuu -m github -s dev -c
./manage.py add_oidc_api -n kukkuu -d https://api.hel.fi/auth -s email,profile -c https://api.hel.fi/auth/kukkuu
./manage.py add_oidc_api_scope -an kukkuu -c https://api.hel.fi/auth/kukkuu-ui -n "Kulttuurin kummilapset" -d"Lorem ipsum"
```

### Install kukkuu locally

Clone the repository (https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/kukkuu). Follow the instructions for running kukkuu with docker. Before running `docker-compose up` set the following settings in kukkuu roots `docker-compose.env.yaml`:

- DEBUG=1
- CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL=1
- TOKEN_AUTH_AUTHSERVER_URL=http://tunnistamo-backend:8000/openid
- APPLY_MIGRATIONS=1
- CREATE_SUPERUSER=1
- TOKEN_AUTH_AUTHSERVER_URL=http://tunnistamo-backend:8000/openid
- MEDIA_ROOT=/app/var/

### kukkuu-ui

Run `docker-compose up`, now the app should be running at `http://localhost:3000/`!
`docker-compose down` stops the container.

OR

Run `yarn && yarn start`
